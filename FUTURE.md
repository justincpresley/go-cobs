# Future Features / Additions

## Stableness
 - Create in-depth testing to ensure compliance and bug detection.
 - Create custom errors for this library.
 - Include charts of each type representing the overhead to help guide users of this library.

## Efficiency
 - Introduce multi-variable assignment throughout.
 - Refactor for performance if possible.

## Functionality
 - A function that combines `Decode()` and `Verify()` in one function to eliminate the need to loop through the data twice.
 - Implement more types and config parameters (listed in [use](https://github.com/justincpresley/go-cobs/blob/master/USE.md)).

## Accessibility
 - Find a good way to specify what/how many bytes cover what in the config (i.e. 30 bytes for Pairs) and implement it.
